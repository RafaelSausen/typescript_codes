# JavaScript Codes

Just some codes to practice JavaScript

## Project Rules

### Clean Code

All project must be implemented using good practices and clean code.

### TDD

The project must be implemented using Test Driven Development. This means the code will be developed using the Red Green Refactor cycle:

- Red: automated tests must be written before the functions. They'll fail (red) because the code to pass doesn't exists.
- Green: the minimal code to pass the test will be written.
- Refactor: the code must be refactored.

### Other Rules

If I remember/create any other rule, I'll update this readme.
